IPA Publisher
=============

IPA Publisher is a simple that automates the generation of .ipa files for OTA Ad-Hoc Distribution. For more information about how IPA Publisher works, check out my blog post about it: http://blog.martinreichart.com/2011/03/over-the-air-ad-hoc-distribution-on-speed/

Feel free to use the application and code in whichever way you'd like. Simple attribution would be nice if you do so.
